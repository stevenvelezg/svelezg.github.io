        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>I'm a college student currently majoring in Computer Science as well as being a junior developer. I'm interested in lots of things tech and otherwise such as gaming, robotics, learning, and music. I excel at creating functional sites quickly but know when to ask for help when needed, knowing I can always learn something new in my work and applying it to my other work.</p>
